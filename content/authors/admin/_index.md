I am an associate professor at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy on Sciences(CAS)](https://english.cas.cn/). I am interested in computer vision and affective computing, particularly in facial expression analysis, gaze estimation, and how to apply them to screen and assess psychological disorders. 

Before joining Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, I obtained my B.S. degree and Ph.D. degree under supervision of Professor [Zhang Xiong](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1121/2556.htm),  from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) (aka Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) in 2011 and 2017, respectively. In the third and the fourth year of my doctoral program, I was a visiting scholar sponsored by China Scholarship Council at [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) in [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Fernando De la Torre](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ftorre/).
